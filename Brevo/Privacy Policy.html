<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Service Providers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Brevo uses a variety of service providers such as data hosting companies, analytics services, email hosting services, and payment processors. The type of information that we share with a service provider will depend on the service that they provide to us. Our service providers are subject to contractual agreements that protect your Personal Information, and we require all service providers to maintain confidentiality standards that are commercially reasonable to ensure the security of your Personal Information. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Government Agencies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Occasionally Brevo may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personal Information to governmental authorities. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Services for illegal activities. Brevo reserves the right to disclose Personal Information to law enforcement and other governmental agencies, at our sole discretion in connection with an investigation of any matter that is illegal or that could expose Brevo or our affiliates to liability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Cookie Information Recipients:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In some cases, we may allow specific cooperating entities to use </span><a href="https://www.brevo.com/legal/cookies/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cookies</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or similar technologies to collect non-personal data from your browser or device for measurement purposes.

<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Affiliates and Third Parties:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may disclose the Personal Information we collect about you to our affiliates like a parent company or subsidiaries. For example, we share Personal Information for Customer support purposes, marketing, or technical operations. Under specific circumstances, we may disclose Personal Information to certain third parties as permitted by applicable law, for example: if we go through a business transition (e.g., merger, acquisition, or asset sale); to comply with a legal requirement or a court order; when we believe it is appropriate to take action regarding illegal activities or prevent fraud or harm to any person; to exercise or defend our legal claims; or for any other reason with your consent.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Aggregated and Deidentified Information</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We reserve the right to disclose aggregated, anonymized, or deidentified information about any individuals with affiliated or nonaffiliated entities for marketing, advertising, research, or other purposes, without restriction.
