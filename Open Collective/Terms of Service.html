Please refer to our <a href="/privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we collect, use and disclose information about you.</p>
<h2 id="1-overview-of-our-platform">1. Overview of Our Platform</h2>
<p>(a) Our Platform provides a platform that may be used by an organization or group with a shared purpose (a &quot;<strong>Collective</strong>&quot;) to work with a Fiscal Host to enable the Collective to collect and disburse funds for expenses that support the Collective. The goal of our Platform is to promote transparency and make it easier to track incoming and outgoing funds for the benefit of the Collective. Below is a list of the different roles that may be associated with each Collective:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Fiscal Host&quot;</strong> - The Fiscal Host is an individual or entity that receives and holds funds contributed by Financial Contributors via the Platform for use in support of a designated Collective. Fiscal Hosts are also referred to as Hosts. Additional terms for Fiscal Hosts are included in Section 7 below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Contributor&quot;</strong> - a Contributor is an individual or entity that participates in the Collective in some way, such as by acting as a Collective Administrator, Financial Contributor, or Expense Submitter, or by participating in any other way, such as attending a Collective’s event.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Collective Administrator&quot;</strong> - A Collective Administrator is a Contributor that has administrator responsibilities for a Collective, including editing its content and the ability to approve expense payments associated with the Collective. Collective Administrators are also referred to as core contributors or admins on the Platform. Additional terms for Collective Administrators are included in Section 5 below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Financial Contributor&quot;</strong> - A Financial Contributor is a Contributor that uses the Platform to contribute funds to a Fiscal Host that are intended to support a particular Collective. Additional terms for Financial Contributors are included in Section 4 below.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>&quot;Expense Submitter&quot;</strong> - a Expense Submitter is a Contributor that submits a payment request in connection with an expense incurred by that user in support of a Collective. Additional terms for Expense Submitters are included in Section 8 below.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) For clarity, our Platform does not store or transmit funds. All funds are stored by Fiscal Hosts, and the Platform is integrated with third-party payment services that process any contributions or disbursements.</p>
<p>(c) You acknowledge and agree that: (i) Open Collective is not a party to and has no responsibility or liability with respect to any communications, transaction, interactions, disputes, or any relationships whatsoever between users; (ii) Open Collective does not have any responsibility to investigate or verify the reputation, conduct, morality or criminal background of any user; and (iii) Open Collective has no responsibility with respect to determining or paying applicable taxes with respect to the Collective or any users.</p>
<h2 id="2-eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>
<p>(a) You must be at least 18 years of age to access or use our Platform. If you are accessing or using our Platform on behalf of another person or entity, (i) you represent that you are authorized to accept these Terms on that person or entity’s behalf and that the person or entity agrees to be bound by these Terms and to be responsible to us if you violate these Terms, and (ii) references to &quot;you&quot; will mean you and that person or entity, collectively. To use the Platform you represent that you have never committed, participated in, or been prosecuted for fraud.</p>
<p>(b) You may not access or use our Platform if you are located in a jurisdiction where the provision of our Platform is prohibited by law (a &quot;<strong>Prohibited Jurisdiction</strong>&quot;), and you may not provide access to our Platform to any entity or individual located in any Prohibited Jurisdiction. You represent and warrant that: (i) you are not named on any U.S. government list of persons or entities prohibited from receiving U.S. exports, or transacting with any U.S. person; and (ii) you are not a national of, or a company registered in, any Prohibited Jurisdiction.</p>
<h2 id="3-user-accounts-and-account-security">3. User Accounts and Account Security</h2>
<p>You may need to register for an account to access some or all of the Platform. If you register for an account, you must provide accurate account information and promptly update this information if it changes. You also must maintain the security of your account and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your account without your permission. You are responsible for all activities that occur in connection with your account and accept all risks of unauthorized access.</p>
<h2 id="4-terms-for-financial-contributors">4. Terms for Financial Contributors</h2>
<p>This Section applies to you if you use the Platform as a Financial Contributor.</p>
<p>(a) **Responsibility. **Before committing to make any contribution via the Platform, each Financial Contributor must (i) read the full description of the Collective and its mission, and (ii) review the criteria and process requirements specified by the Collective and its Host (if any) for receiving expense payments. By contributing to the Fiscal Host for designation to a Collective, you agree to look solely to the applicable Contributors or Fiscal Host of the applicable Collective to resolve any questions or disputes regarding contributions or expected payments.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>Contributions.</strong> Each contribution you make is paid directly to the Fiscal Host of the Collective. The contribution is held by the Host, and our Terms require the Host to use the full amount (less our transaction fees, any third-party payment service fees and any Host fees specified via the Platform) in support of the Collective you have designated. Our Platform allows you to use and store a payment method via the Platform that is acceptable to us (&quot;<strong>Payment Method</strong>&quot;) to pay for any contributions or to receive any expense payments. You represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the Payment Method. You authorize our designated third-party payments processor to charge the amount specified to your Payment Method for any contribution you authorize via the Platform. If the Payment Method cannot be verified, is invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your contribution may be suspended or cancelled automatically. Some Payment Methods may be offered as separately branded payment services (such as PayPal), and you agree to comply with the terms of those services.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Recurring Payments.</strong> You may authorize a recurring contribution to a Host for designation to a Collective by indicating as much through the Platform (&quot;<strong>Recurring Contribution</strong>&quot;). For a Recurring Contribution, you are authorizing our designated third-party payment service to charge the amount specified to your Payment Method on the day that the initial contribution is made and to charge the same amount at the beginning of every calendar month thereafter (or the beginning of every year if the renewal period is annual). For example, if you initiate a recurring payment of $10 on January 25th, you will be charged $10 on that day, and $10 on February 1st and the first day of every calendar month thereafter until you cancel. WHEN YOU INITIATE A RECURRING CONTRIBUTION TO A HOST FOR DESIGNATION TO A COLLECTIVE, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT OUR THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT SERVICE IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE YOU ON A MONTHLY BASIS (OR ANNUAL BASIS IF SPECIFIED VIA THE PLATFORM) FOR THE SAME PAYMENT AMOUNT UNTIL YOU CANCEL IT OR WE SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING YOU ACCESS TO THE PLATFORM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Cancellations.</strong> Financial Contributors can cancel or change the amount of a Recurring Contribution via <a href="https://www.opencollective.com/recurring-contributions">opencollective.com/recurring-contributions</a>.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Refunds.</strong> Except as provided in these Terms, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FINAL, AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS. You agree (i) to look solely to the Contributors or Host of an applicable Collective to resolve any disputes regarding contributions that you make via the Platform, and (ii) that the Collective Administrator or Host are solely responsible for providing any refunds. Any refunds initiated by Contributors or Hosts via the Platform may be credited to the Payment Method maintained in your account.</p>
<p>(f) <strong>Recognition.</strong> Financial Contributors may receive certain advertising, marketing, or other recognition (&quot;<strong>Recognition</strong>&quot;) in exchange for their contributions. Subject to these terms, all Financial Contributors will receive the following Recognition: logo placement on the Collective page together with a link to the Financial Contributor’s profile page (“<strong>Baseline Recognition</strong>”). Financial Contributors may receive additional Recognition if specified by an Collective Administrator within the applicable Collective page. Each Financial Contributor acknowledges and agrees that any Recognition beyond the Baseline Recognition is provided solely by the Collective Administrator and the Host of the applicable Collective, and that Open Collective is not responsible for fulfilling any, and does not make any representations or warranties with respect to, such supplemental Recognition offered by the Collective. Financial Contributors agree to look solely to the applicable Host or Collective Administrator regarding receipt of any supplemental Recognition.</p>
<p>(g) <strong>Intellectual Property Rights.</strong> To receive Baseline Recognition, Financial Contributors must provide a logo or similar branding material via the Platform. To the extent a Financial Contributor provides any trademarks, trade names, logos or other branding materials to Open Collective (&quot;<strong>Financial Contributor Marks</strong>&quot;), the Financial Contributor hereby grants (i) to Open Collective a non-exclusive, sublicensable license to use and display the Financial Contributor Marks via the Platform for purposes of fulfilling the Baseline Recognition and any supplemental Recognition offered by the applicable Collective, and (ii) to the Collective Administrator, a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use and display the Financial Contributor Marks as mutually agreed upon by the Financial Contributor and the Collective Administrator in connection with any supplemental Recognition.</p>
<h2 id="5-terms-for-collective-administrators">5. Terms for Collective Administrators</h2>

<h2 id="7-terms-for-hosts">7. Terms for Hosts</h2>
<p>This Section applies to you if you use the Platform as a Host.</p>
<p>(a) <strong>Set-Up.</strong> Any person or entity seeking to serve as Host for a Collective must be approved via the Platform. All Hosts must acquire and maintain a valid financial account with one of the third-party payment services specified and designated by Open Collective, and agree to, and comply with, any applicable terms of those third-party services.</p>
<p>(b) **Contributions. **You agree to accept contributions of funds from Financial Contributors for designation to a specific Collective (&quot;<strong>Collective Funds</strong>&quot;). You must take accounting measures to segregate Collective Funds from your other funds, and maintain and use the Collective Funds solely for the benefit of the designated Collective and in accordance with these Terms. The Platform is designed to assist you in satisfying these responsibilities, by enabling you to export the global ledger and helping you to track the budget of each Collective to determine whether the Collective is operating as intended.</p>
<p>(c) <strong>Expense Payments.</strong> You may receive requests for payment of Collective Funds in the form of Expenses (<strong>Expenses</strong>) from Collective Administrators in connection with expense payment requests submitted by Expense Submitters. Expenses must be approved by a Collective Administrator through the Platform before they are eligible for payment. You are responsible for reviewing Expenses to confirm that they meet the Collective’s applicable criteria and process requirements for payment, and only authorizing disbursements if the Expense meets such requirements and is permitted under applicable law. If the Expense meets such requirements, you will authorize disbursement of the applicable amount of Collective Funds via the Platform.</p>
<p>(d) <strong>Host Fees</strong>. You may charge a reasonable fee to the Collective in exchange for providing host services,. You must disclose this fee clearly and conspicuously in advance of accepting any Collective Administrator’s request that you serve as a Host for a Collective.</p>
<p>(e) <strong>Tax Deduction.</strong> You are responsible for providing any tax receipts, if applicable, to Financial Contributors who make contributions. Our Platform helps facilitate your compliance responsibilities by issuing receipts to Financial Contributors. However, you are responsible for providing all the details that will appear on those receipts to make sure that they can be tax deductible receipts (if applicable).</p>
<p>(f) <strong>Compliance.</strong> You must comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in connection with your Host activities, including money transmission, record keeping, accounting, tax, and other compliance requirements. You represent and warrant that (i) you have full power and authority to perform the obligations to the Collective; (ii) your use of the Platform, and performance under these Terms, will not violate any contractual or other restrictions applicable to you or any applicable law, rule or regulation.</p>
<p>(g) If a Collective is terminated with an outstanding balance of Collective Funds, you will use or disburse the remaining funds in accordance with applicable law and your bylaws (if applicable).</p>
<h2 id="8-expense-submitter-terms">8. Expense Submitter Terms</h2>
<p>Expense Submitters must only submit requests for payment via the Platform for expenses they actually incurred in support of a Collective. Any payment request made through the Platform must include a valid invoice or receipt indicating the expenses actually incurred by the Expense Submitter, and any other information required by the Host or Contributors of that Collective. Expense Submitters are solely responsible for submitting accurate information via the Platform for their designated payment account. At the minimum, such expense or invoice should include the date, the full legal name and address of the provider of the good or service and the final amount paid, including tax if applicable. This information is not automatically published by us via our Platform, and we we require Hosts and Contributors via these Terms not to disclose the information to third parties.</p>

<h2 id="20-dispute-resolution-binding-arbitration-for-us-residents">20. Dispute Resolution; Binding Arbitration for U.S. Residents</h2>
<p><strong>If you are a resident of the U.S. this Section 21 applies. Please read the following section carefully because it requires residents of the United States to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Open Collective and limits the manner in which they can seek relief from us.</strong></p>
<p>(a) Except for small claims disputes in which you or Open Collective seek to bring an individual action in small claims court located in the county of your billing address or disputes in which you or Open Collective seeks injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, you and Open Collective waive your rights to a jury trial and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Platform resolved in court. Instead, all disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or our Platform will be resolved through confidential binding arbitration held in San Francisco, California in accordance with the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures (&quot;<strong>Rules</strong>&quot;) of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (&quot;<strong>JAMS</strong>&quot;), which are available on the <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a> and hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand the rules of JAMS or waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS are unfair or should not apply for any reason.</p>
<p>(b) <strong>You and Open Collective agree that any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or our Platform is personal to you and Open Collective and that any dispute will be resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of representative proceeding.</strong></p>
<p>(c) You and Open Collective agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of this Section 18 will be substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the &quot;FAA&quot;), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one individual. You and Company agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will pay the filing fee and Company will pay the remaining JAMS fees and costs. For any arbitration initiated by Company, Company will pay all JAMS fees and costs. You and Open Collective agree that the state or federal courts of the State of California and the United States sitting in San Francisco, California have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award.</p>
<p>(d) ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR OUR PLATFORM MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER SUCH CLAIM AROSE; OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AND OPEN COLLECTIVE WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASSERT THE CLAIM.</p>
<p>(e) You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 18 by contacting us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3d4e484d4d524f497d524d58535e525151585e49544b58135e5250"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="50232520203f2224103f20353e333f3c3c3533243926357e333f3d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
